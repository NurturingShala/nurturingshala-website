HOW TO ADD YOUR IMAGES TO THE WEBSITE
=====================================

1. Save your images with these exact names in the 'images' folder:

   OCEAN YOGA IMAGE:
   - Save as: /Users/nurturewithyoga/yoga-website/images/yoga-nature.jpg
   - This will appear as the hero background

   CHAIR YOGA IMAGE:
   - Save as: /Users/nurturewithyoga/yoga-website/images/chair-yoga.jpg
   - This will appear in the Chair Yoga service card

   FESTIVAL TEACHING IMAGE:
   - Save as: /Users/nurturewithyoga/yoga-website/images/festival-class.jpg
   - This will appear in the Buddhafield Festival event

2. Make sure the file names are EXACTLY as shown above (case-sensitive)

3. Once saved, refresh your website and the images will appear automatically!

Current placeholder files that need to be replaced:
- yoga-nature.jpg (currently just text)
- chair-yoga.jpg (currently just text) 
- festival-class.jpg (currently just text)

The website code is already set up to display these images once you save them with the correct names.
