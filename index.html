                    <p>Chair yoga is an excellent way for seniors to stay active and maintain their mobility and flexibility, even if they have limited mobility or balance issues. It's a beneficial and safe practice. Offer private chair yoga sessions for seniors in care homes.</p>
                    <p>These sessions are tailored specifically to their needs and abilities, and are conducted in a safe and supportive environment.</p>
                    <p>During the 30-minute session, we focus on gentle movements and stretches that can be done in the chair to help improve circulation, reduce stiffness, and increase range of motion. We also practice breathing exercises and relaxation techniques to help calm the mind and reduce stress.</p>
                    <p>My goal is to help seniors improve their physical and mental wellbeing, and to provide a sense of connection and community through the practice of yoga.</p>

                    <p>Namaste everyone! My name is Ankit, and I am a yoga teacher with a therapeutic approach. My journey to yoga started as a filmmaker, but I found myself seeking a deeper understanding of myself and the world around me. This led me to the path of yoga, and I never looked back.</p>
                    <p>I hold a Master's degree in Yoga, where I gained academic knowledge and skills in Hatha Yoga, anatomy, philosophy, and nutrition, with a focus on a holistic approach to yoga therapy. I also spent several years learning the deeper methods of yoga and body alignment at the <a href="https://www.hiyogacentre.com" target="_blank">Himalayan Iyengar Yoga Center</a>.</p>
                    <p>My teaching style is rooted in traditional yoga principles, combined with a therapeutic approach. I believe that yoga is not just about the physical practice, but also about healing and transforming the mind and spirit. I offer regular classes and workshops, as well as personalized one-to-one sessions to help you develop your own practice and address specific concerns.</p>
                    <p>In my classes, I emphasize the importance of proper alignment, breath awareness, and mindful movement. Whether you're new to yoga or a seasoned practitioner, my classes are designed to be accessible and challenging, with modifications offered for all levels.</p>
                    <p>I believe that yoga is not just a physical practice, but a way of life that can help us cultivate greater awareness and I'm passionate about sharing this ancient wisdom with everyone and helping them discover the transformative power of yoga.</p>
                    <p>Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to schedule a class. I look forward to practicing with you soon!</p>
